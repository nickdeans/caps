# CAPS application
I created an application that emulates a real world supply chain. The app simulates delivery service where vendors will ship products using my delivery service and when driver deliver them, customers will be notified up packages that are picked up, in-transit, and delivered with event driven functionality. The app utilizes real time communication as well as a first in first out queue system.
